The package uses value objects to parse, serialize and build [HTTP Structured Fields][1] in PHP.

HTTP Structured fields are intended for use by specifications of new HTTP fields that wish to 
use a common syntax that is more restrictive than traditional HTTP field values or could
be used to [retrofit current fields][2] to have them compliant with the new syntax.

The package can be used to **parse, build, update and serialize** HTTP Structured Fields in a predicable way;

```php
use Bakame\Http\StructuredFields\Item;

$field = Item::from("/terms", ['rel' => 'copyright', 'anchor' => '#foo']);
echo $field->toHttpValue();                // display "/terms";rel="copyright";anchor="#foo"
echo $field->value();                      // display "/terms"
echo $field->parameters()['rel']->value(); // display "copyright"
```

## System Requirements

**PHP >= 8.1** is required but the latest stable version of PHP is recommended.

## Installation

Use composer:

```
composer require bakame/http-structured-fields
```

or download the library and:

- use any other [PSR-4][4] compatible autoloader.
- use the bundle autoloader script as shown below:

~~~php
require 'path/to/http-structured-fields/repo/autoload.php';

use Bakame\Http\StructuredFields\OuterList;

$list = OuterList::fromHttpValue('"/member/*/author", "/member/*/comments"');
echo $list[-1]->value(); // returns '/member/*/comments'
~~~
